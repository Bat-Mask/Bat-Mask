## Industrial Robots
I have experience working with renowned industrial robot platforms, including KUKA and Yaskawa. My projects involve developing applications for robotic automation, optimizing manufacturing processes, and enhancing overall efficiency.

## Industrial PLCs
Proficient in Siemens PLC programming, my expertise extends to designing and implementing control systems for industrial processes. I have successfully integrated PLCs into various automation projects, ensuring seamless operation and reliability.

## Programming Languages
My coding skills encompass Python, C, and C++, allowing me to create versatile and efficient software solutions for robotics and industrial automation. The code in this repository reflects my commitment to writing clean, maintainable, and well-documented software.

## 3D Printing
In addition to my expertise in robotics and automation, I am actively involved in 3D printing. I use my Sidewinder X2 printer to bring ideas to life, prototyping components and exploring the intersection of robotics and additive manufacturing.

## 3D Printer: Sidewinder X2
The Sidewinder X2 is my go-to 3D printer for prototyping and creating custom parts. Its large build volume and precise printing capabilities make it an integral tool in my engineering toolkit.
